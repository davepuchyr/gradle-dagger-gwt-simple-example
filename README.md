# Gradle dagger gwt example

## About

This repository was created as an example how to build gwt project with dagger dependency injection using gradle. Classes used for this example are from [Dagger 2's repository][repo]. Classes were slightly modified to comply gwt needs.

## Status

Dagger 2.3 version is working. Problem was with dependencies on com.google.guava, and specially order of dependencies. Many thanks to Thomas.
